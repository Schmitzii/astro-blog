This is a love letter to CSE 134. It's the best course in the world. Yeeeeah, and it shows me everything I need to know. 

## Why should you pick CSE 134

I am going to convince you now.

### It's awesome

Really awesome. I am just writing stuff here so the page doesn't look too empty. It doesn't even matter what I write blablablabalblablalblablablalblab. Very interesting course I really like it.

### Material is always adapting

For example, we learned about view transitions. It's a relatively new concept in Web Development and used to have smooth page transitions.
